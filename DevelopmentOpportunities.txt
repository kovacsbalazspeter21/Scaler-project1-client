This system is a centralized internal platform for employee productivity, collaboration, and personal development tracking, built using:

 - Frontend: React + Next.js (SSR, API Routes, Routing)
 - Backend: Django (with REST API or GraphQL)
 - Auth: JWT/Auth tokens with Django backend, stored via HttpOnly cookies or localStorage in Next.js
 - Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite (for local dev)
